Grapes Clothing E-Commerce Site


The website serves the purpose of allowing users to be able to purchase clothing from Grapes Clothing.
 The webiste consists of 3 pages. 
The Landing/Home Page, firstly have a advertisement (hyperlink through image) to the sales page, followed by the Top sales item (Hot selling item.) Which imaghes can be clicked and be led to to the store page. At the footer of every page, there will be a contact form, "about" which contains basic information for a clothing store / ecommerce store. There is also basic contact information at the footer. A javascript for this page would be the contact form. Next the Store Page. The store page has a nav bar that allows you to click each type of clothing that grapes clothing sell. The nav bar will disapear when scolling downwards or when the specific type of clothi ng is clicked. it will reappear by scrolling up. this is for the experience to be more minimalistic and have a cleaner look when shopping for the users.At the bottom there is a cart where user can select the quantity of item they want and the price will automatically be cauculated. The user can check out at this part as well. A javascript for this page would be the contact form and that there will be a popup if the user tries to click "add to cart" twice (quantity can be decided at cart.). There is also the same footer on this page. Lastly , the games page. The user can earn a vocher after hitting specific points which can be changed monthly. The games objective is to score as much points as possible by destroying as many dots as possible. The game would sa ve the points and automatically lock the user from starting the game till the following monday.


Design Process
For the Design Process, We built this website with the goal of making a clean and new e-commerce site and experience for users with a dedicated page for a game that allows the user to be able to win vouchers. The webiste were designed specifically with the customer in mind. From the contact and basic information in the footer, the nav bar at the store page which disapperas and re appears for the purpose of minimalism and to allow user to have more screen space when viweing the item. To the home page with the clickable images for the ongoing sale and top sales item. 
Hence the design process goal was to be able to put the website to the best light for the users, in terms of aesthetics, fucntionality and easy to get help from customer service,

In the future, We hope to be able to learn the skills and develop a even better and better looking website with maybe more added features such as magnifying image when the user holds the item image.

This Website uses HTML for the base of the website. CSS for the design and Javascript for some animation and for the game.

A bug I have is that when the email form is clicked, it automatically bring the user to a " page not found " in the future i hope to gain the ability to be able to have the mail app popup and automatically fill in the email details for the viewers conveninence
